"""Stage 2 workflow: selection + points search + intelligent filtering.

This SequentialAgent represents the second stage of the simplified Capstone
architecture. It assumes that:
    - Stage 1 has already populated `bangumi_candidates` in session state.
    - The current user input expresses a choice among those candidates.

Planned sub-agents (final design):
    1. UserSelectionAgent      – interpret user choice into selected_bangumi
    2. PointsSearchAgent       – fetch ALL Anitabi points for that bangumi
    3. PointsSelectionAgent    – LLM selection of the best 8–12 points
    4. RoutePlanningAgent      – call a custom tool to generate final route

In this step we wire the first three; RoutePlanningAgent will be added once
the route planning tool is implemented in a later phase.
