class SimpleRoutePlanner:
    """
    Simplified route planner used by the Capstone implementation.

    Strategy:
    - Sort points by (episode, time_seconds) as a proxy for narrative order.
    - Take the first N points (default 10) to keep the route manageable.
    - Generate a human-readable route description and coarse estimates for
      duration and distance.

    This is intentionally heuristic and deterministic – the goal is to
    showcase custom tool integration rather than perfect routing.
